<H2>Backstory</H2>
<P>It is the year of 2028. Humanity has finally broken new ground in exploring and settling Mars. It's a massive undertaking, sponsored and kick-started 
by numerous space agencies and space enterprises. Now new colonies are being sprouted up all over on this new continent, forming new human societies as we speak in this new world.</P>

<P>For sure, no two settlements are the same. They all have their own unique objectives and identify. They may start from a simple four-person initial landing habitat and go from there. 
There are also mining towns whose sole purpose is to prospect minerals. There are also well developed bases hosting dozens of people and specialized buildings. </P>

<P>Thankfully, settlers are skillful and resourceful. They are bringing their unique life experiences as well as their areas of expertise to this new world. 
Some love to tend greenhouses to feed the populace. Some manufacture useful products. Some prospect for minerals. Some maintain vehicles and equipment. Some 
engage in scientific inquiries about the origin of life, etc.</P>

<P>That said, some prefer to venture out on rover missions to study the surrounding area, explore uncharted territories, 
prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and trade with their neighboring settlements.</P>

<P>Mars's magnificent landscape is an untamed beauty but it can be hostile to the unsuspected. Has it always been a big, lifeless rock ? 
Its past ecosystem, if any, awaits humanity's investigation. </P>

<P>Settlers come face-to-face with meteorite impacts, radiation sickness, equipment malfunctions, accidents, illnesses, injuries, and even death. 
Survival depends on how well they work together in harmony, how they use their survival instincts and skills, and how they must balance their 
individual needs versus settlement goals.</P>

<P>As settlers survive hardship and build up their settlements, they are rewarded with the pure joy of participating in this 
grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society on another planetary surface.</P>

<P>Living and thriving on Mars is full of challenges for sure. There are no success practices that one can follow. But at the end, 
it will worth the sum of all our efforts as we are becoming a multi-planetary species continuing our stories of someday living among the stars.</P>
