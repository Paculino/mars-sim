<h2>Resource : "Taenite" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li>Taenite is a major constituent of iron meteorites.
	 An alloy of iron and nickel, with nickel proportions of 20% up to 65%. The name is derived
	 from the Greek meaning band or ribbon. In octahedrites it is found in bands interleaving
	 with kamacite forming Widmanst√§tten patterns, whereas in ataxites it is the dominant
	 constituent. In octahedrites a fine intermixture with kamacite can occur, which is
	 called plessite. Taenite is one of four known Fe-Ni meteorite minerals: The others are
	 kamacite, tetrataenite, and antitaenite.</li></ul></p><br/>
