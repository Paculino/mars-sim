<h2>Resource : "Acetylene" (Gas)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li>Acetylene is a colorless gas that has a strong 
	 garlic-like odor. When combined with oxygen, it becomes very hot and is classified as the hottest fuel gas. 
	 It is also the only fuel gas that can weld and cut steel, making it the preferred choice for welders.
	 The welding process that uses acetylene is known as oxy-fuel cutting or gas cutting. Acetylene is 
	 probably the hottest burning fuel gas available to us. Acetylene releases almost 40% of its heat in 
	 the inner flame cone. Acetylene is also commonly used for the production of other chemicals used 
	 in perfumes, vitamins, polymers, solvents and other materials due to its versatility and ease of
	 reactive control in comparison to other gases. It combines nicely with a variety of elements and
	 compounds, making it the most important of starting materials for organic synthesis.</li></ul></p><br/>
