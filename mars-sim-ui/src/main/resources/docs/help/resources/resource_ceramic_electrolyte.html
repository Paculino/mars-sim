<h2>Resource : "Ceramic Electrolyte" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li> 
		The ceramic electrolyte 
		is highly ion-conductive and chemically stable for making batteries and fuel cells. 
		This solid metal oxide is an insulator that will not conduct electricity. However, it 
		is capable of conducting oxygen ions and suitable for cell reactions. </li></ul></p><br/>
